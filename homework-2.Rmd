 Linear Regression

For this lab, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1198/8002/products/1d89434927bffb6fd1786c19c2d921fb_2000x_652a2391-5a0a-4f10-966c-f759dc08635c_1024x1024.jpg?v=1582320404){width="152"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!


### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(workflows)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(parsnip)
```

```{r}
abalone <- read.csv("C:/Users/yli102/Desktop/abalone.csv")
```

```{r}
age<- c(abalone$rings + 1.5)
abalone$age<-age
ggplot(data=abalone,aes(x=age))+geom_histogram(color='blue')
```

### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

```{r}
set.seed(200)
abalone1 <- subset(abalone, select = -rings)
split_abalone <- initial_split(abalone1, prop = 0.70, strata = age)
training_abalone <- training(split_abalone)
training_abalone
testing_abalone <- testing(split_abalone)
testing_abalone
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you should not include `rings` to predict `age`. Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors

2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.


```{r}
first_recipe<-recipe(age~.,data = training_abalone)%>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors())
first_predict<-first_recipe %>%
  step_interact(terms = ~starts_with("type"):shucked_weight+longest_shell:diameter+
                  shucked_weight:shell_weight) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors())
  
first_predict
```
In the Question 1, `age` has been set to the number of `rings` + $1.5$, so there is no need to use `rings` to predict `age`.

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

```{r}
Lin_Reg_Model<-linear_reg()%>%
  set_engine("lm")

Lin_Reg_Model
```

### Question 5

Now:

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model you created in Question 4, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

```{r}
LModel_wflow<-workflow() %>%
  add_model(Lin_Reg_Model) %>%
  add_recipe(first_recipe)

LModel_wflow
  
```

### Question 6

Use your `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1.

```{r}

predict_age <- data.frame( type = 'F',longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, shell_weight = 1)
abalone_reg_wflow_fit <- fit(LModel_wflow,training_abalone)
predict(abalone_reg_wflow_fit, predict_age)
```

### Question 7

Now you want to assess your model's performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **training data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R^2^* value.

```{r}
library(yardstick)
new_training_abalone <- predict(abalone_reg_wflow_fit, new_data = training_abalone %>% select(-age))
new_training_abalone <- bind_cols(new_training_abalone, training_abalone %>% select(age))
rmse(new_training_abalone, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
metrics_set <- metric_set(rmse, rsq, mae)
metrics_set(new_training_abalone, truth = age, 
                estimate = .pred)
```

 The result shows that the *R^2^* value is $0.5290525$, which is lower than $0.95$, so this model is unreliable.
